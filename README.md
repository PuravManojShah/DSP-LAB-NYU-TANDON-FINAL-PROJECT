# DSP-LAB-NYU-TANDON-FINAL-PROJECT
This repository contains the implementation of a real time drowsiness detection system completed as part of the requirements for the final project for the course DSP Lab at NYU Tandon School Of Engineering.\
The goal of this project is to take an input live video stream which is nothing but a collection of frames of images and depending on each frame check if the eyes of the concerned person in the frame is opened or closed.\
If the eyes of the concerned person is closed for more than a certain number of frames then an inference is made that the person might be asleep and an alarm is sounded to alert and wake up the person.
